        Hello, so I was playing around and came up with this speech synthesis api helper function, this takes a section of your blog
        or webpage and reads it out. <br> Add the voice function to the an onclick attribute with the argument being
        that of the div containing the text to read and you are good to go! Cool isnt it?? well thats the awesomess of JavaScript!!
        Fork this repo and add more features. I think I am too lazy to do that. LOL! I will keep adding new features and
        might eventually decide on making a library. cheers!!

        <input id='btn' type='button' onclick="voice('blog1')" value='voice out'>
    </div>
